    <p class="page-description">It's important to stay healthy during pregnancy as many health risk factors are out there that can affect you and your unborn baby. There are certain types of foods you arent able to eat as they can cause miscarriage, preterm delivery, birth defects or stillbirth.</p>
    <p class="page-description">The following of those foods are: Raw meat, uncooked seafood or uncooked beef or poultry should definately be avoided as it can contain a risk of contamination with Salmonella, toxoplasmosis and coliform bacteria all of which you dont want your precious baby to ingest. Anything including deli meats to raw vegetables that havent been cleaned properly, soft cheeses
      such as Brie, feta, gorgonzola, goat cheese only to name a few, raw or undercooked eggs, unpastuerized anything really and certain types of fish such as raw shellfish or shark, etc. can all contain risks of Listeria.
      <p class="page-description">Caffeine intake should also be limited to just about 200mg a day as it can cause babies to have a low birthweight.</p>
      <p class="page-description">Always wash your fruits and vegetables thoroughly as traces from soil in which they grew from can contain these risks. Some fruits such as Papaya, grapes and pineapple are also best to avoid as they can lead to early labour. Always avoid drugs, smoking and alcohol which as you know can cause many complications.</p> <p class="page-description">Any medications you decide to take or are taking at the moment always consult your doctor first if it is safe for the baby. If you have diabetes
      make sure to get your blood sugar content under control as elevated blood sugar can lead to fetal malformation or loss.</p>
      <p class="page-description"> It's also important to hydrate yourself by drinking atleast 8 glasses of water a day.</p>
      <p class="page-description"> Make sure that you are also getting enough sleep and if you need to, take some power naps as sleeping a good amount is essential in pregnancy.</p>
      <p class="page-description">Always pack healthy snacks on the go. You don't want to eat junk food and you want to make sure you are getting the nutrition you and your baby needs. Plus, munching
        on small snacks such as crackers throughout the day can help ease nausea if you have morning sickness.</p>
