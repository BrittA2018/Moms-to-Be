    <center>
   <p class="page-description">Ahhh, you have reached this glorious stage of your pregnancy where you will get to see your beautiful growing baby more clearer on ultrasounds. Where your baby is developing more and more each day and becoming to look more like an actual baby.</p>
<p class="page-description">In this stage you will get to feel the "flutters" those little hands and feet punching and kicking as it grows rapidly each day and soon those little flutters will continue with more force.
This is the time to get started on taking care of a few more things before delivery comes as it's right around the corner now.</p>
<p class="page-description">If you haven't already and feel the need to do so, now's the time to
think about joining a prenatal exercise class. This class will encourage you to bond and get support from other mothers to be and will also help you stay in shape.</p>
<p class="page-description">Your second trimester prenatal visits
will consist of more tests to ensure you and your baby are healthy by the time the due date arrives. You'll have blood tests such as the glucose screening to check for gestational diabetes,
and you will be offered a wide screening test of over many chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders and nueral tube defects.</p>
<p class="page-description">You might want to start shopping now for maternity clothes as your tummy will only increase in size and make it more difficult to fit in those jeans you once wore in your perfectly toned shape before pregnancy. Most moms-to-be start looking the part around 12 to 18 weeks.
Do not go crazy though, shopping for these clothes, only buy the absolute essentials during your pregnancy process because after delivery you will get to snap back to your lovely shape and you will need to store those clothes if you happen to plan another pregnancy along the way.
You may also want to start moisterizing your belly as those stretch marks will start to appear and moisterizing may not reduce all of those stretch marks but can reduce the itchiness you might feel during it.</p>
<p class="page-description">Start deciding with your partner whether or not you'd both like to know the sex of the baby because genitals in this stage are fully developed now so start preparing those cute baby names you have in mind if you have either or.</p>
<p class="page-description">If you feel more comfortable this way, now is the time to decide whether to hire a professional labor coach.
A trained labor coach can assist you through delivery with emotional support if you feel the need to do so.</p>
<p class="page-description">You may want to speak to your partner or if you're doing this on your own, now might be a good time to start doing the adult activities you can't do when the baby comes out your
precious womb. So enjoy this baby-free time that you have to go to a live music performance or a late night movie or to catch up with some friends for a nice dinner reservation. Just activities that would be a little less complicated when having a baby.
However, avoid any unsafe activities such as surfing, downhill skiing, iceskating...Anything that will
carry a high risk of you falling and causing trauma to your abdomen.</p>
<p class="page-description">If you have older children or pets now's the time to start preparing them for a sibling on the way. You may also want to create a baby registry for an upcoming baby shower a friend or family member you know will throw one. Its a great thing to let people know exactly
what you want and need for the new baby to come.</p>
