      <h3>Pre-Delivery Budget Planning</h3>
    </nav>
<p class="page-description">Create a savings account for the baby. If you haven’t already done so, start now while your baby is still in the tummy.
  It’s a good way to secure your babys future with going to college, having the extra money to buy your child any luxury
  they potentially might need and making sure they are financially set if a rainy day expense were to come. You should also figure
  out how your baby will affect your tax return status.
  <p class="page-description">If you're still working now is the time to start planning your maternity leave. Check in with your human resources department to find out what benefits you're eligible for, whether you're paid during that period and if you need to fill out any paperwork in advance to save you the hassle right before you're ready to give birth.
  This is also a good time to start thinking if you'd like to stay at home with your baby full-time or part-time or stay at your current job after your leave and if so, to finish any tasks and responsibilites that you have in your position before passing it along to your other co-workers while you're not there.</p>
</p>
<p class="page-description">Make sure
you are covered under health insurance because doctor visits that also include ultrasounds can get pretty expensive, if applied to any deductibles you have on your plan.
So make sure you are applying for the plan that is right for you up to delivery where you dont have any high medical expenses besides the extra preparing for a baby expense that you already have to manage your budget on.</p>
<p class="page-description">Plan your post-delivery budget because recurring costs such as diapers, child care and extra food can take a hold on your overall household expenses for many years ahead.</p>
<p class="page-description">When your baby is born make sure to add your child to your health insurance during the first 30 days of birth because you don't want your baby to get sick and he or she has no health coverage.</p>
<p class="page-description">If you decide to work after your baby is born start planning on child care on how much it will cost you to hire a nanny or the right day care which can take awhile to find. Not to mention completing an application and going through the approval process if required. You'll want to know if
  how much it will cost and if you can afford this along with your other expenses. So plan ahead!</p>
