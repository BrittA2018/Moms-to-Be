  <p class="page-description">The first step if you know you're truly pregnant and you've taken the pregnancy home tests or did blood work to confirm, you can start to take your prenatal vitamins as these vitamins contain folic acid which is an essential part during your whole pregnancy process.
Folic acid reduces your baby's risks of developing neural tube defects such as spina bifida.</p>
<p class="page-description">Next, you'll want to choose a healthcare provider if you don't already have one, one that participates with your insurance.</p>
<p class="page-description">Once you have confirmed that you are pregnant and started taking your prenatal vitamins and have a doctor in mind you can make your first prenatal appointment. Make sure you keep track
  of the first day of your last period as it will determine the date you conceived and the estimated due date of delivery. Also jot down any questions you might have as there are alot of necessary steps you will have to follow during your pregnancy.</p>
  <p class="page-description">Consult your doctor of any medications you are taking and if you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise many problems during pregnancy. This includes
    miscarriage, placental problems, preterm birth and it also can increase the risk of stillbirth which can lead to infant death. Another horrible thing to do while pregnant is drinking alcohol.
    Alcohol can give your baby a risk of learning disabilities (speech, attention span, language).</p>
    <p class="page-description"> These first few months in the first trimester may be tough to handle with morning sickness or you may be lucky as i was and not have any morning sickness at all. But if you do, just a few pointers, there are ways to relieve that.
      You can try to eat smaller meals or snacks and stick to bland, room temperature foods. I've heard sucking on a lemon can ease nausea as well. If you simply can't hold anything down, talk to your healthcare provider about prescribing you a safe anti-nausea medication that is safe for you and your baby.</p>
      <p class="page-description"> Talk to your partner about parenting to decide how you want to both raise your child and if you're doing it alone ask yourself or make a list of the way you think will be right to raise your child if you are going to be recieving help from family members as well.</p>
