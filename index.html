<p class="page-description">Feeling nervous, excited, or scared of becoming a first time mom?
Don’t worry, that’s exactly how I felt.
Going through my first pregnancy I didn’t know how to come in terms with it. I was surprised at first as soon as I peed on that stick and two lines popped up.
When I was on my way to tell my husband I couldn’t believe it myself.  He was of course shocked himself but was very happy to know that he was going to be a father.</p>
<p class="page-description">I knew what this meant and I knew I had a lot of thinking to do for the next nine months because within those two minutes of waiting to see two lines on that stick, I knew my world would change.
I knew that my future had shifted and i knew that i had a new responsibility. I knew that i'd have to manage my finances not to mention if the insurance would cover all my expenses (ultrasounds, doctor visits, going into labor at the hospital). I'd have to prepare on what to do with my career in order to give this baby everything it wanted and needed. I knew that i'd have to take care of my health more. I knew that i'd have to provide a comfortable, clean and more spacious living space than I already had been living in for the past year.</p>
<p class="page-description">So here I was, making lists and trying to organize myself better to prepare for the next nine months to come. All of this was just giving me a big headache but knowing i'd be a mommy soon I had that motherly instinct to pull through and make ends meet before the “big deadline” (the due date) and this is why I created this website. So feel free to check out my lists on the tabs above for tips and any questions you might have while being in the spectacular process to becoming a mom!</p>
