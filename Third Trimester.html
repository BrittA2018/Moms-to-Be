  <p class="page-description">So you've finally reached the last stage in pregnancy and you are now closer than ever to deliver that precious bundle of joy. In this trimester, since you have already
  done so much planning in your second trimester, you get to sit back, relax and enjoy your last moments of being pregnant.</p>
  <p class="page-description">During this stage, it's important to keep
track of your baby's movements. If you sense a decrease in your baby's movements that may signal a problem and you need to tell your doctor if you may need some more testing or a regular
checkup to see if everything is okay with your little one. Your visits to the doctor at this stage will most likely switch from once a month to every two weeks and then once a week until
you deliver.</p>
<p class="page-description">If you feel the need to do so, you can start taking more classes such as breastfeeding, infant CPR and on baby care. If you plan on breastfeeding as buying formula can be quite
expensive, a class may be beneficial to help you start or you can start reading articles on the best ways to get your little one to stick to breastfeeding. Know the certain positions
and know the benefits of breastfeeding.</p>
<p class="page-description">This is the time to start choosing a pediatrician that maybe some of your friends or family members
have good recommendations you can start with. If not, you can search for a doctor that participates with your insurance, has phenomenol reviews and one that's convenient for you and your schedule.
But keep in mind that once your baby is born he or she will have his or her first doctor visit right after birth so make sure you have one already set in stone by then.</p>
<p class="page-description">There are other questions you may want to consider thinking about now as well such as:
If you are having a boy, would you like him to be circumcised? If you are religious will you be having a religious ceremony after your baby is born? Are you planning on teaching them multiple languages? So start thinking about these things as your due date gets closer.</p>
<p class="page-description">Start washing your baby's clothing and bedding
with a gentle detergent. The one that i use is Dreft which makes the clothes feeling soft and non-irritant on a baby's soft skin. Before your baby's arrival make sure to have someone to clean your house to avoid any dust particles
or dirt and also because you wont have anytime to clean it yourself after having a newborn!</p>
<p class="page-description">Start packing an emergency bag before your water breaks so you have all the necessary essentials going into the hospital.
Some key things you will want to bring are: insurance card, toiletries, comfy clothing (expect to be there for atleast two-three days), phone charger to contact family and friends during your wait,
a going home outfit for the baby as they wont provide one for you as well as plenty of snacks for you after labor since it will be a long process. Your doctor may have given you a form to pre-register you to the hospital
so make sure that you fill this out weeks before delivery so you or your partner don't have to think about this while there. If you have a car make sure to have a car seat for the baby as the hospital will not allow you to take the baby home without one.</p>
<p class="page-description">I hope these tips have helped you during the spectacular process to becoming a mom and now you are ready to show your little one to the world! Congratulations!</p>
