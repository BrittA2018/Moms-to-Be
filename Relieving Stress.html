    <h3>Relieving Stress During Pregnancy</h3>
    </nav>

  <p class="page-description">Prepare yourself for whats to come.
Although it is not as necessary, take a breathing class or a yoga class, exercise or get prenatal massages. You'll want to be as relaxed as possible before delivery.
Calming your muscles and nerves tend to lead to a more relaxed delivery. With all that anxiety and stress building up with all these future plans you have to think about now it cant take a huge hold on you and make you feel overwhelmed so donâ€™t be afraid to treat yourself every now and then as you prepare for the big day.</p>
<p class="page-description">Exercise and stay active as it's a proven way to lift your spirits, make you feel good and reduce stress all at once.</p>
<p class="page-description">Having sex during pregnancy is also a big stress reliever and if you feel like doing it then why not? Remember the baby is protected in your womb and you wont hurt the baby if you feel the need to orgasm every now and then. Unless you're having any complications
  sex can become dangerous so talk to your doctor if you are to be on the safe side.</p>
  <p class="page-description">Remember to stay positive during your pregnancy as any outside stress, whether it's emotional, financial, mental or physical can probably affect your baby. Although, chronic stress has minimal affect such as (preterm birth and low birth weight), just stay positive and happy because it's good for you and your baby to relax in a calm state of mind.
Lean on people who you know can support you through those stressful times as it helps to talk about with someone close to you and can make your pregnancy seem less stressful.</p>
